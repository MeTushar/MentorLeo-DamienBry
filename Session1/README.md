[Detail of this project](https://medium.com/@tmtushar28/i-started-learning-react-again-c936a59f3d05#.r5jz8ba5i)

In this Session1 I have created my portfolio using react js & I am also fetching some job offers from github using jQuery.

##How to see the end Result for this session?

Clone my repo or fork it or even you can download it as zip then go inside public folder inside Session1 in terminal using 
```
Cd Session1/public
```

Do a npm install to install all the dependencies make sure you have node & npm installed in your system. Run the command below
```
npm install
```
Then run this command 

```
npm start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ & you'll be seeing my work it's just starting
