# What change session 2 folder has then session 1 

In this Session2 I have created my portfolio using react js & I am also fetching some job offers from github using fetch-jsonp package from npm. jQuery was pretty heavy because all I was doing with jquery to fetch data from github apis.

I have deleted jQuery package using command below.
```
npm uninstall jquery
```

##How to see the end Result for this session?

Clone my repo or fork it or even you can download it as zip then go inside public folder inside Session1 in terminal using 
```
Cd Session2/public
```

Do a npm install to install all the dependencies make sure you have node & npm installed in your system. Run the command below
```
npm install
```
Then run this command 

```
npm start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ & you'll be seeing my work it's just starting
